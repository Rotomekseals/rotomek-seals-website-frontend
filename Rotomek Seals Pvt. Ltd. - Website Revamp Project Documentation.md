### Background and Objectives

Rotomek Seals Pvt. Ltd., established in 1996, has evolved from a small repair shop to one of India's leading mechanical seal manufacturers. With over 2000 customers across multiple industries including automobile, pharmaceutical, oil & gas, chemical processing, FMCG, breweries, and dairy sectors, the company required a digital presence that would effectively communicate their expertise and capabilities to both existing and potential customers.

The primary objectives of this website revamp project were to create a modern, professional website that would serve as a comprehensive digital showcase of Rotomek Seals' products and services while providing the company with the tools necessary to maintain and update their online presence independently. The project aimed to establish a strong foundation for digital marketing efforts, improve search engine visibility, and enhance customer engagement through improved user experience and functionality.

### Technical Architecture

The website employs a modern full-stack architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and performance. The frontend utilizes React 18 with Vite as the build tool, providing fast development and optimized production builds. The component library leverages Tailwind CSS for styling and Shadcn/UI components for consistent design patterns, while Lucide React provides a comprehensive icon system.

The backend infrastructure is built on Flask, a lightweight yet powerful Python web framework that provides RESTful API endpoints for content management. The system uses SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool with SQLite as the database for development and testing, though the architecture supports easy migration to PostgreSQL or MySQL for production environments.
